## Using the Model Creator
The Model Creator is a simple tool to allow you to quickly create models for PlayFab based on [PlayFab's REST API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/playfab/admin/?view=playfab-rest).

Open a model definition in the browser and fill in title and data according to the image below:

This will not always generate perfect models. Specifically Type hints are likely to not compile. Either because there was an oversight on implementing the Model Creator, or because the docs are broken or you need to create another, downstream Model.

While it is not perfect, it still saves a *ton* of time.


## Implementing a Model with an Array of Objects
Some Request models have properties, which are arrays of Objects.

<div style="color: indianred">If the elements in this array will be custom classes in Godot, serialization of them will <b><u>fail</u></b>!</div>

In order for them to correctly serialize, you need to do the following steps:

1. Create a new Class, inheriting from `AbstractJsonSerializableCollection`. It does not need to carry any further implementation. Example:
    ````gdscript
    extends AbstractJsonSerializableCollection
    class_name EventContentsCollection
    ````
2. Instead of an `Array`, the property should use the newly created collection class. See the `Events` property below:
    ````gdscript
    extends JsonSerializable
    class_name WriteEventsRequest
    
    # Collection of events to write to PlayStream.
    var Events: EventContentsCollection    
    
    func _init():
        Events = EventContentsCollection.new()
    ````
