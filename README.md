# godot-playfab - for Godot 4!
is an [Azure PlayFab](https://playfab.com) addon for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). While it is very early, it is supposed to be two things:

1. A GDScript-native SDK to Azure PlayFab
2. A Godot Editor integration to administer your game

> **Note:**
>   If you are looking for the Godot 3 version, you can use a [legacy version of godot-playfab for Godot 3!](https://github.com/Structed/godot-playfab/tree/godot3)

## Motivation
I wanted to create an opinionated, "natural" Godot integration/SDK.
Anyone could use the C# SDK right now or use any SDK with GDExtension. But these SDKs are only generated SDKs, with a lot of duplicated models, which are nothing more than an API wrapper. However, I want it to feel natural to the environment of Godot.

So my plan is to not only create a GDScript-Native addon with more or less everything handcrafted,
but also use Godot's Signals and also provide in-editor tools to work with Godot.

**The overarching mission is:** *Providing a great Developer Experience!*
