# godot-playfab
is an [Azure PlayFab](https://playfab.com) addon for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). While it is very early, it is supposed to be two things:

1. A GDscript-native SDK to Azure PlayFab
2. A Godot Editor integration to administer your game

## Motivation
I wanted to create an opinionated, "natural" Godot integration/SDK.
Anyone could use the C# SDK right now or use any SDK with GDnative. But these SDKs are only generated SDKs, with a lot of duplicated models, which are nothing more than an API wrapper. However, I wan it to feel natural to the environment of Godot.

So my plan is to not only create a GDScript-Native with more or less everything handcrafted,
but also use Godot's Signals and also provide in-editor tools to work with Godot.
